#### istage.R ---- functions needed to perform i-stage re-sampling/approximation
#
# included functions:
#
# (1) fit_resid(): given a dataframe that contains the partition of a parameter
# space (and some other related arguments), perform *one* further layer of
# partitioniong, using partition_opt() function to determine the optimal 
# residual value for each partition. This repartitioning is different from the
# first layer of partioning in that for layer 2 onward, we are fitting the 
# residuals, rather than the psi values. The idea is that as we go deeper
# and deeper recursively, we improve the original approximation incrementally
#
# (2) compute_expterms(): uses the log-sum-exp trick to compute the final
# approximation to the log marginal likelihood
#
# (3) partition_opt(): similar to u_star() function in partition.R, except this
# function searches for the optimal partition value using the loss function that
# favors the min value for each partition
#
#
